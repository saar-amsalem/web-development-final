Sportswear Brand Store
Welcome to our final project in the Web Development Course! Our project is a sportswear brand store, designed to showcase our skills and knowledge in web development. This single-page application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

Project Overview
Our sportswear brand store is a comprehensive web application that offers a seamless shopping experience for customers interested in high-quality sportswear products. With a sleek and intuitive user interface, users can easily navigate through different product categories, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout effortlessly.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user authentication ensures that only registered users can access certain features such as saving items to their wishlist and viewing their order history.
Product Catalog: Browse through a wide range of sportswear products, including athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories, with detailed product descriptions and images.
Shopping Cart: Add desired items to the shopping cart, where users can review their selections, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout seamlessly.
Checkout Process: A streamlined checkout process allows users to enter shipping and payment information efficiently, making it convenient to complete purchases.
Wishlist: Save favorite items to a wishlist for future reference, providing users with a personalized shopping experience.
Order History: Registered users can view their order history, including previous purchases and order statuses, providing transparency and convenience.
Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts: frontend and backend. Each part serves a specific purpose and is implemented using different technologies.

Frontend (React)
The frontend of our application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With React, we created dynamic and interactive components that make up the user interface of our sportswear brand store. Leveraging React's component-based architecture, we achieved modularity and reusability, resulting in a clean and maintainable codebase.

Backend (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)
The backend of our application is powered by Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Node.js provides a scalable and efficient runtime environment for server-side code, while Express.js simplifies the process of building robust APIs. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, serves as the data storage solution, allowing us to store and retrieve product information, user data, and order details efficiently.

Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the frontend directory and run npm install to install dependencies.
Navigate to the backend directory and run npm install to install dependencies.
Start the frontend server by running npm start in the frontend directory.
Start the backend server by running npm start in the backend directory.
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
